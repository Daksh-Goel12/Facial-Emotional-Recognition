<h1>Webcam-face-Emotion-Detection</h1>
<p>Real time face detection streamlit based application</p>
<p>
This Facial Expression Recognition System utilizes Python, TensorFlow, and Keras for model development, complemented by a Streamlit and HTML-based user interface. Designed to interpret diverse facial expressions, the system adheres to ethical and privacy standards while considering potential data limitations. Face detection employs Haar Cascade, and the model recognizes emotions such as Neutral, Sad, Surprise, and Happy based on distinct facial features.</p>

<h2>Model Purpose</h2>
<ul>
<li>Developed using Python with appropriate libraries/packages.</li>
<li>Utilizes TensorFlow and Keras for efficient model training.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Web/User Interface</h2>
<ul>
